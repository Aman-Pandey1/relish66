# SPA fallback for client-side routing when serving static build via Express
# Express already sends index.html for unknown paths in production (see server/src/server.js)
# If in future we serve static directly from Caddy, uncomment below to enable rewrites:
# @static {
#   file
#   path "/client/dist/*"
# }
# handle_path /* {
#   try_files {path} {path}/ /client/dist/index.html
# }
